- 👋 Hi, I’m @emmakschu, Emma K Schumacher (she/they). I am a transfemme/genderfluid person who loves all things STEM. I sort of fell into a long-term job in 
agronomy as a jack-of-all-trades doing everything from collecting and analyzing soil data samples, to mapping irrigation systems, to using evapotranspiration
data to maximize irrigation efficiency, to building a database with web interface for mechanics to manage parts inventory, etc. I enjoyed the variable work,
but had to leave after coming-out because the industry is so rife with homophobia and transphobia.
- 👀 I’m interested in spatial data, Python, SQL, Linux admin, LaTeX typesetting, music score engraving, etc
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Rust, kernel dev
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that helps me grow my skills in a welcoming, supportive environment
- 📫 The easiest way to reach me is via email, emma.k.schu (at) gmail
